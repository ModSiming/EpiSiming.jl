# EpiSiming.jl

Epidemics simulator (Julia version).

This is the Julia version of [ModSiming/EpiSiming]().

## A random scenario example

The core engine is implemented, but so far we have only build one scenario, which is a random scenario on a rectangular area. A scenario for the city of Rio de Janeiro has been implemented in the python version of the project and will soon be adapted to julia and included here.

For the random scenario, have a look [Epidemic simulation via a discrete-time, agent-based stochastic model with a random scenario](docs/src/examples/random_scenario.md).
